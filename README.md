I'll try to keep this updated to define what the various nonsense in here attempts to accomplish.

PlatformsPerCPM: This provides a string that can be used for the "PlatformsToManage" found in the CPM.ini
   
   Next steps:
   
      Call .bat file to update the value in the CPM.ini automagically.
      
      Test with mutliple CPMs and larger dataset.
